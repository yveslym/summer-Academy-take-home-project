### Apple Movie App
A project created by Yves Songolo <br>
Email: Yves.songolo@students.makeschool.com

### Introduction:

Apple Movie App is an iOS mobile app that lists 25 best movie <br>
from AppleStore, and allow a user to buy the movie on the AppleStore <br>
and watch movie trailer as well. <br>

### Technical Specification:

To accomplish this task, I use the apple movie API to retrieve all <br>
the necessary content and I parse the JSON using the "Decodable protocol". Also,<br>
 I create a movie model with all the necessary properties needed.<br>
I only use one library from cocoa pods [chameleon](https://github.com/ViccAlexander/Chameleon) that allows me to retrieve <br>
the movie poster image color to add to the buy, and watch trailer button.<br>

### Installation

To run this project all you need to do is to either fork or download the file and then<br>
run the project (easy, right?)

### Time to Built the project

Overall it took me 1 to 2h to complete the app, and 2 more hour to play with the UI
